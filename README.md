# Merab-Gomez-Psych259-FinalProject
### This is the repository for my PSYC 259 Final Project

The **Before** Folder contains all files from the original project *BEFORE* taking PSYC 259.

This includes: 
- a screenshot of how I stored my files
- the original dataset
- a word document with my copied and pasted original R code and output
- a short word document giving a brief overview of the study (sent to me from my PI)

The **MG PSYC 259 Final Project** Folder contains all the new and updated files that incorporated the information I learned *AFTER* taking PSYC 259.

This includes: 
- screenshots of how I have now stored my files (in a GitHub repository and in the lab's Google Drive)
- the dataset (same as the original)
- an R Markdown file of my updated code
- an HTML file of my knitted R Markdown File
- a detailed code book of the dataset (that I created myself)
