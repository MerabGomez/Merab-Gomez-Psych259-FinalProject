# Merab-Gomez-Psych259-FinalProject
This is the repository for my PSYC 259 Final Project

The Before Folder contains all files from the original project before taking PSYC 259.

This includes:
-a screenshot of how I stored my files
-the original dataset
-a word document with my copied and pasted Rcode and output
-a short document giving a bried overview of the study (sent over by my PI)

The MG PSYC 259 Final Project Folder contains all the new and updated files that incorporate the information I learned AFTER taking PSYC 259.

This includes:
-screenshots of how I have now stored my files (in a repository and in the lab's Google Drive)
-the dataset (same as the original)
-an R Markdown file of my code
-an HTML file of my knitted RMarkdown File
-a detailed code book of the dataset (that I created myself)
